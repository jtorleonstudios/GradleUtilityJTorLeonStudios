# Gradle utility for Minecraft development

Scalable gradle script collection for minecraft mod development

Run `npm run postinstall` after getting the project to configure the utility scripts, because the project uses hard-coded file/folder paths. 

Use `apply from: "path"` to use a include script, or point directly to the `includes/common.gradle` file
